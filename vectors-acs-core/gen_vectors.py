The specification this corpus tests carries no requirement identifiers. Its
normative sentences are addressable today only by section number and by line,
and both of those move on an edit that changes nothing. So the corpus mints an
identifier per requirement and binds it to the sentence by digest: the sentence
is quoted here, located in the vendored copy, and hashed, and a reword that
leaves the section number alone fails the generator rather than silently
re-pointing every vector that cites it.

An identifier that named a section would survive a reword and mean something
different afterwards. An identifier bound to a digest cannot.

Every member of this suite in one table, rejected and accepted alike.
Ground truth: the four normative files vendored in `spec-vendored/`, read at
`{TARGET_COMMIT[:7]}` of `{TARGET_REPO}`, each pinned by sha256 in
`MANIFEST.json`.

This corpus is {total} vectors, of which {accept} a conformant verifier must
not fail closed on and {reject} it must reject.

**No implementation has been run against this corpus.** There is no reference
adapter in the specification's repository at the pinned commit, and the two
pull requests that carried one are closed. So the suite ships with a self-check
and with no observed results, and the count above describes inputs with
declared expectations rather than anything measured. A table quoting it carries
that sentence.

**Identifiers are minted here and bound to a sentence, not to a section.** The
specification carries no requirement identifiers at the pinned commit, so a
vector citing a section number would survive a reword and silently mean
something else afterwards. Each row below quotes its normative sentence, the
generator locates that sentence in the vendored copy and hashes it, and a
reword stops the build rather than re-pointing every vector that cites it. The
line number is derived from the sentence and never typed.

**A verdict is asserted as a code, never as prose.** Two conformant
implementations word one refusal differently and a wrong one can word the right
cause while doing something else, so a member names a value from the fixed
error registry or names none at all.

**There are three verdicts.** A member whose property the specification cannot
express is `unmeasurable`, with the reason recorded. Folding those into
rejections would credit an implementation for behaviour nothing requires;
folding them into passes would hide the gap. {indeterminate} member carries
that verdict today.

Regenerate byte-identically: `python3 gen_vectors.py`.
Self-check: `aee-verify vectors-acs-core/` from the repository root.
