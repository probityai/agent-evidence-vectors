# Conformance vectors (ACS-Core negative suite)

Every member of this suite in one table, rejected and accepted alike.
Ground truth: the four normative files vendored in `spec-vendored/`, read at
`9d4a9da` of `GenAI-Security-Project/agent-control-standard`, each pinned by sha256 in
`MANIFEST.json`.

This corpus is 34 vectors, of which 11 a conformant verifier must
not fail closed on and 22 it must reject.

**No implementation has been run against this corpus.** There is no reference
adapter in the specification's repository at the pinned commit, and the two
pull requests that carried one are closed. So the suite ships with a self-check
and with no observed results, and the count above describes inputs with
declared expectations rather than anything measured. A table quoting it carries
that sentence.

**Identifiers are minted here and bound to a sentence, not to a section.** The
specification carries no requirement identifiers at the pinned commit, so a
vector citing a section number would survive a reword and silently mean
something else afterwards. Each row below quotes its normative sentence, the
generator locates that sentence in the vendored copy and hashes it, and a
reword stops the build rather than re-pointing every vector that cites it. The
line number is derived from the sentence and never typed.

**A verdict is asserted as a code, never as prose.** Two conformant
implementations word one refusal differently and a wrong one can word the right
cause while doing something else, so a member names a value from the fixed
error registry or names none at all.

**There are three verdicts.** A member whose property the specification cannot
express is `unmeasurable`, with the reason recorded. Folding those into
rejections would credit an implementation for behaviour nothing requires;
folding them into passes would hide the gap. 1 member carries
that verdict today.

Regenerate byte-identically: `python3 gen_vectors.py`.
Self-check: `aee-verify vectors-acs-core/` from the repository root.

## Families

| id | what the family is |
|---|---|
| `acs-f-1` | correctly signed and outside the granted mandate |
| `acs-f-2` | a consumed authorization presented a second time |
| `acs-f-3` | valid at issuance and invalid at execution time |
| `acs-f-4` | an approval valid for one agent or tool presented for another |
| `acs-f-5` | structurally broken evidence with a consumer that proceeds |
| `acs-f-6` | an action whose observability references were removed |
| `acs-f-7` | steps in mandate individually and out of mandate in aggregate |
| `acs-f-8` | attributed content standing in for an authorization |
| `acs-f-9` | a handshake or a disposition answered outside the negotiated contract |

## Deliberately out of scope

An open pull request is moving these surfaces. A vector written against one
now is a vector rewritten when it lands.

| surface | why |
|---|---|
| the MODIFY disposition and its composition rules | an open pull request moves MODIFY support out of the mandatory profile and adds a new section for the declaration, and neither the new section nor the declaration field exists at the pinned commit |
| the liveness ping method | the same pull request moves it out of the mandatory profile |
| the second half of the subagent hook pair | split out of the mandatory set by a later push on the same pull request |
| the wrapped tool-protocol methods | the same pull request has moved these twice and they currently sit back at mandatory for sessions that use them, so their status is unsettled rather than relaxed |
